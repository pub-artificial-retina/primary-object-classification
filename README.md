# primary-object-classification
This project involves the classification of identified objects into primary and non-primary categories, which is crucial for reducing the power stimulation required by the artificial retina chip. By effectively distinguishing between primary and non-primary objects, we aim to enhance the visual experience provided by the artificial retina chip.
